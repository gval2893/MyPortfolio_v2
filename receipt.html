    <h2>History of the dish</h2>
    <p>
      In fact, the apple charlotte comes from British shores, and it was likely
      named after George III's wife, Charlotte. For a regal pudding, it has
      surprisingly economical credentials: the pudding is simply an apple purée,
      encased in strips of butter-licked white bread.

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>

    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour - 1 cup</li>
      <li>Sugar - 1 glass</li>
      <li>Eggs - 3 pcs.</li>
      <li>Apples - 3-4 pcs.</li>
      <li>Vanillin (vanilla sugar) - to taste</li>
      <li>Baking soda - a pinch</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat the eggs into the mixer bowl. Add sugar. Beat with a mixer, first
        at medium, then at high speed until a light yellow mass of homogeneous
        consistency is obtained.
      </li>
      <li>Add flour to the sweet egg mixture, previously sifted through a fine sieve with a pinch of soda and vanillin (vanilla sugar). Beat again with a mixer. The charlotte dough is ready.</li>
      <li>Prepare the charlotte filling. Wash the apples and cut each one in half. Remove the cores with seeds. Peel the pulp and cut into small cubes or slices of any shape.</li>
      <liAdd apples to the charlotte dough and mix carefully. Pour the resulting mass into a mold greased with any fat and send it to the oven, heated to 190°C, for 30 minutes.></li>
